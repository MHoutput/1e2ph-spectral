# Summary
PhonoPy postprocessing code to calculate the 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function from first principles, useful for long-range nonlinear electron phonon interaction

# Dependencies
1e2ph-spectral is fully written in Python and requires the following external python libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pyyaml
- joblib
- itertools
- warnings

# Basic usage
## Code
- *main.py* reproduces all figures from arXiv:2412.09470. Set recalculate=True to explicitly recalculate the 1-electron-2-phonon spectral functions; otherwise, this data is read from the precalculated *results* directory.
- *minimal_example.py* generates the basic figures for LiF to illustrate the basic usage of the code
- *phonopyReaders.py* contains all functions and classes that interface with the PhonoPy data. See minimal_example.py or main.py for example usage.
- *pathsLabels.py* contains a method that contains information for the high-symmetry paths of cubic Brillouin zones.

## Directories
- *data* contains the relevant output data from PhonoPy, ultimately derived from first-principles calculations in VASP.
- *plots* contains the figures generated by *main.py*.
- *results* contains .npz files that contain the numerical data of calculated 1-electron-2-phonon spectral functions, which is read by *main.py*.
